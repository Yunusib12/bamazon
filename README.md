# Welcome To BAMAZON

### Overview

Welcome to Bamazon! This is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. 

Within the customer portal, you can view the inventory, choose an item you'd like to purchase
along with the quantity, and voila! Transaction complete! However, if we do not have enough 
of the selected item in stock deeming us unable to fulfill your purchase, the transaction 
will not go through.

Within the manager portal, you can view all inventory in the store, view all low
inventory (less than 5 items in stock), choose to up the inventory back to the correct amount
needed, and even add new items to your inventory!

**1. Customer Interface**

The customer interface allows the user to view the current inventory of store items: item IDs, descriptions, department in which the item is located and price. The user is then able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. If the selected quantity is currently in stock, the user's order is fulfilled, displaying the total purchase price and updating the store database. If the desired quantity is not available, the user is prompted to modify their order.

**2. Manager Interface**

The manager interface presents a list of four options, as below.
